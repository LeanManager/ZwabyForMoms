We enable homeowners to book cleaning services on-demand!

These are the things we need to add to the current Xamarin.Forms app
so we can release fast to the Apple and Google Play stores (not including UI):

1) One-time password (OTP) verification in the registration screen.
2) Azure SQL database to store user registrations.
3) Azure push notifications to alert users strategically.
4) Email notification API to alert us when users book a cleaning service.
5) Stripe API to accept electronic payment from users.
